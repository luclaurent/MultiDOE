0007     Notice
0008 
0009 This Agreement is a Free Software license agreement that is the result
0010 of discussions between its authors in order to ensure compliance with
0011 the two main principles guiding its drafting:
0012 
0013   * firstly, compliance with the principles governing the distribution
0014     of Free Software: access to source code, broad rights granted to users,
0015   * secondly, the election of a governing law, French law, with which it
0016     is conformant, both as regards the law of torts and intellectual
0017     property law, and the protection that it offers to both authors and
0018     holders of the economic rights over software.
0019

0038     Preamble
0039 
0040 The purpose of this Free Software license agreement is to grant users
0041 the right to modify and redistribute the software governed by this
0042 license within the framework of an open source distribution model.
0043 
0044 The exercising of this right is conditional upon certain obligations <span class="keyword">for</span>
0045 users so as to preserve this status <span class="keyword">for</span> all subsequent redistributions.
0046 
0047 In consideration of access to the source code and the rights to copy,
0048 modify and redistribute granted by the license, users are provided only
0049 with a limited warranty and the software's author, the holder of the
0050 economic rights, and the successive licensors only have limited liability.
0051 
0052 In this respect, the risks associated with loading, using, modifying
0053 and/or developing or reproducing the software by the user are brought to
0054 the user's attention, given its Free Software status, which may make it
0055 complicated to use, with the result that its use is reserved <span class="keyword">for</span>
0056 developers and experienced professionals having in-depth computer
0057 knowledge. Users are therefore encouraged to load and test the
0058 suitability of the software as regards their requirements in conditions
0059 enabling the security of their systems and/or data to be ensured and,
0060 more generally, to use and operate it in the same conditions of
0061 security. This Agreement may be freely reproduced and published,
0062 provided it is not altered, and that no provisions are either added or
0063 removed herefrom.
0064 
0065 This Agreement may apply to any or all software <span class="keyword">for</span> which the holder of
0066 the economic rights decides to submit the use thereof to its provisions.
0067

0350 
0351 7.1 Under no circumstances shall the Agreement oblige the Licensor to
0352 provide technical assistance or maintenance services <span class="keyword">for</span> the Software.
0353 
0354 However, the Licensor is entitled to offer this type of services. The
0355 terms and conditions of such technical assistance, and/or such
0356 maintenance, shall be set forth in a separate instrument. Only the
0357 Licensor offering said maintenance and/or technical assistance services
0358 shall incur liability therefor.
0359 
0360 7.2 Similarly, any Licensor is entitled to offer to its licensees, under
0361 its sole responsibility, a warranty, that shall only be binding upon
0362 itself, <span class="keyword">for</span> the redistribution of the Software and/or the Modified
0363 Software, under terms and conditions that it is free to decide. Said
0364 warranty, and the financial terms and conditions of its application,
0365 shall be subject of a separate instrument executed between the Licensor
0366 and the Licensee.
0367 
0368

0373 from the Software as a result of a fault on the part of the relevant
0374 Licensor, subject to providing evidence thereof.
0375 
0376 8.2 The Licensor's liability is limited to the commitments made under
0377 this Agreement and shall not be incurred as a result of in particular:
0378 (i) loss due the Licensee's total or partial failure to fulfill its
0379 obligations, (ii) direct or consequential loss that is suffered by the
0380 Licensee due to the use or performance of the Software, and (iii) more
0381 generally, any consequential loss. In particular the Parties expressly
0382 agree that any or all pecuniary or business loss (i.e. loss of data,
0383 loss of profits, operating loss, loss of customers or orders,
0384 opportunity cost, any disturbance to business activities) or any or all
0385 legal proceedings instituted against the Licensee by a third party,

0388 
0389 
0390     Article 9 - WARRANTY
0391 
0392 9.1 The Licensee acknowledges that the scientific and technical
0393 state-of-the-art when the Software was distributed did not enable all
0394 possible uses to be tested and verified, nor <span class="keyword">for</span> the presence of
0395 possible defects to be detected. In this respect, the Licensee's
0396 attention has been drawn to the risks associated with loading, using,
0397 modifying and/or developing and reproducing the Software which are
0398 reserved <span class="keyword">for</span> experienced users.
0399 
0400 The Licensee shall be responsible <span class="keyword">for</span> verifying, by any or all means,
0401 the suitability of the product <span class="keyword">for</span> its requirements, its good working
0402 order, and <span class="keyword">for</span> ensuring that it shall not cause damage to either persons
0403 or properties.
0404 
0405 9.2 The Licensor hereby represents, in good faith, that it is entitled
0406 to grant all the rights over the Software (including in particular the
0407 rights set forth in Article 5 &lt;#scope&gt;).
0408 
0409 9.3 The Licensee acknowledges that the Software is supplied &quot;as is&quot; by
0410 the Licensor without any other express or tacit warranty, other than
0411 that provided <span class="keyword">for</span> in Article 9.2 &lt;#good-faith&gt; and, in particular,
0412 without any warranty as to its commercial value, its secured, safe,
0413 innovative or relevant nature.
0414 
0415 Specifically, the Licensor does not warrant that the Software is free
0416 from any error, that it will operate without interruption, that it will
0417 be compatible with the Licensee's own equipment and software
0418 configuration, nor that it will meet the Licensee's requirements.
0419 
0420 9.4 The Licensor does not either expressly or tacitly warrant that the
0421 Software does not infringe any third party intellectual property right
0422 relating to a patent, software or any other property right. Therefore,
0423 the Licensor disclaims any and all liability towards the Licensee
0424 arising out of any or all proceedings <span class="keyword">for</span> infringement that may be
0425 instituted in respect of the use, modification and redistribution of the
0426 Software. Nevertheless, should such proceedings be instituted against
0427 the Licensee, the Licensor shall provide it with technical and legal
0428 expertise <span class="keyword">for</span> its defense. Such technical and legal expertise shall be
0429 decided on a <span class="keyword">case</span>-by-<span class="keyword">case</span> basis between the relevant Licensor and the
0430 Licensee pursuant to a memorandum of understanding. The Licensor
0431 disclaims any and all liability as regards the Licensee's use of the
0432 name of the Software. No warranty is given as regards the existence of
0433 prior rights over the name of the Software or as regards the existence
0434 of a trademark.
0435 
0436 
0437     Article 10 - TERMINATION
0438 
0439 10.1 In the event of a breach by the Licensee of its obligations
0440 hereunder, the Licensor may automatically terminate this Agreement
