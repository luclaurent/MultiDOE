0002                        Version 3, 29 June 2007
0003 
0004  Copyright (C) 2007 Free Software Foundation, Inc. &lt;http://fsf.org/&gt;
0005  Everyone is permitted to copy and distribute verbatim copies
0006  of this license document, but changing it is not allowed.
0007 
0008                             Preamble
0009 
0010   The GNU General Public License is a free, copyleft license <span class="keyword">for</span>
0011 software and other kinds of works.
0012 
0013   The licenses <span class="keyword">for</span> most software and other practical works are designed
0014 to take away your freedom to share and change the works.  By contrast,
0015 the GNU General Public License is intended to guarantee your freedom to
0016 share and change all versions of a program--to make sure it remains free
0017 software <span class="keyword">for</span> all its users.  We, the Free Software Foundation, use the
0018 GNU General Public License <span class="keyword">for</span> most of our software; it applies also to
0019 any other work released this way by its authors.  You can apply it to
0020 your programs, too.
0021 
0022   When we speak of free software, we are referring to freedom, not
0023 price.  Our General Public Licenses are designed to make sure that you
0024 have the freedom to distribute copies of free software (and charge <span class="keyword">for</span>
0025 them <span class="keyword">if</span> you wish), that you receive source code or can get it <span class="keyword">if</span> you
0026 want it, that you can change the software or use pieces of it in new
0027 free programs, and that you know you can do these things.
0028 
0029   To protect your rights, we need to prevent others from denying you
0030 these rights or asking you to surrender the rights.  Therefore, you have
0031 certain responsibilities <span class="keyword">if</span> you distribute copies of the software, or <span class="keyword">if</span>
0032 you modify it: responsibilities to respect the freedom of others.
0033 
0034   For example, <span class="keyword">if</span> you distribute copies of such a program, whether
0035 gratis or <span class="keyword">for</span> a fee, you must pass on to the recipients the same
0036 freedoms that you received.  You must make sure that they, too, receive
0037 or can get the source code.  And you must show them these terms so they
0038 know their rights.
0039 
0040   Developers that use the GNU GPL protect your rights with two steps:
0041 (1) assert copyright on the software, and (2) offer you this License
0042 giving you legal permission to copy, distribute and/or modify it.
0043 
0044   For the developers' and authors' protection, the GPL clearly explains
0045 that there is no warranty <span class="keyword">for</span> this free software.  For both users' and
0046 authors' sake, the GPL requires that modified versions be marked as
0047 changed, so that their problems will not be attributed erroneously to
0048 authors of previous versions.
0049 
0050   Some devices are designed to deny users access to install or run
0051 modified versions of the software inside them, although the manufacturer
0052 can do so.  This is fundamentally incompatible with the aim of
0053 protecting users' freedom to change the software.  The systematic
0054 pattern of such abuse occurs in the area of products <span class="keyword">for</span> individuals to
0055 use, which is precisely where it is most unacceptable.  Therefore, we
0056 have designed this version of the GPL to prohibit the practice <span class="keyword">for</span> those
0057 products.  If such problems arise substantially in other domains, we
0058 stand ready to extend this provision to those domains in future versions
0059 of the GPL, as needed to protect the freedom of users.
0060 
0061   Finally, every program is threatened constantly by software patents.
0062 States should not allow patents to restrict development and use of
0063 software on general-purpose computers, but in those that do, we wish to
0064 avoid the special danger that patents applied to a free program could
0065 make it effectively proprietary.  To prevent this, the GPL assures that
0066 patents cannot be used to render the program non-free.
0067 
0068   The precise terms and conditions <span class="keyword">for</span> copying, distribution and
0069 modification follow.
0070 
0071                        TERMS AND CONDITIONS
0072 
0073   0. Definitions.
0074 
0075   &quot;This License&quot; refers to version 3 of the GNU General Public License.
0076 
0077   &quot;Copyright&quot; also means copyright-like laws that apply to other kinds of
0078 works, such as semiconductor masks.
0079 
0080   &quot;The Program&quot; refers to any copyrightable work licensed under this
0081 License.  Each licensee is addressed as &quot;you&quot;.  &quot;Licensees&quot; and
0082 &quot;recipients&quot; may be individuals or organizations.
0083 
0084   To &quot;modify&quot; a work means to copy from or adapt all or part of the work
0085 in a fashion requiring copyright permission, other than the making of an
0086 exact copy.  The resulting work is called a &quot;modified version&quot; of the
0087 earlier work or a work &quot;based on&quot; the earlier work.
0088 
0089   A &quot;covered work&quot; means either the unmodified Program or a work based
0090 on the Program.
0091 
0092   To &quot;propagate&quot; a work means to do anything with it that, without
0093 permission, would make you directly or secondarily liable <span class="keyword">for</span>
0094 infringement under applicable copyright law, except executing it on a
0095 computer or modifying a private copy.  Propagation includes copying,
0096 distribution (with or without modification), making available to the
0097 public, and in some countries other activities as well.
0098 
0099   To &quot;convey&quot; a work means any kind of propagation that enables other
0100 parties to make or receive copies.  Mere interaction with a user through
0101 a computer network, with no transfer of a copy, is not conveying.
0102 
0103   An interactive user interface displays &quot;Appropriate Legal Notices&quot;
0104 to the extent that it includes a convenient and prominently visible
0105 feature that (1) displays an appropriate copyright notice, and (2)
0106 tells the user that there is no warranty <span class="keyword">for</span> the work (except to the
0107 extent that warranties are provided), that licensees may convey the
0108 work under this License, and how to view a copy of this License.  If
0109 the interface presents a list of user commands or options, such as a
0110 menu, a prominent item in the list meets this criterion.
0111 
0112   1. Source Code.
0113 
0114   The &quot;source code&quot; <span class="keyword">for</span> a work means the preferred form of the work
0115 <span class="keyword">for</span> making modifications to it.  &quot;Object code&quot; means any non-source
0116 form of a work.
0117 
0118   A &quot;Standard Interface&quot; means an interface that either is an official
0119 standard defined by a recognized standards body, or, in the <span class="keyword">case</span> of
0120 interfaces specified <span class="keyword">for</span> a particular programming language, one that
0121 is widely used among developers working in that language.
0122 
0123   The &quot;System Libraries&quot; of an executable work include anything, other
0124 than the work as a whole, that (a) is included in the normal form of
0125 packaging a Major Component, but which is not part of that Major
0126 Component, and (b) serves only to enable use of the work with that
0127 Major Component, or to implement a Standard Interface <span class="keyword">for</span> which an
0128 implementation is available to the public in source code form.  A
0129 &quot;Major Component&quot;, in this context, means a major essential component
0130 (kernel, window system, and so on) of the specific operating system
0131 (<span class="keyword">if</span> any) on which the executable work runs, or a compiler used to
0132 produce the work, or an object code interpreter used to run it.
0133 
0134   The &quot;Corresponding Source&quot; <span class="keyword">for</span> a work in object code form means all
0135 the source code needed to generate, install, and (<span class="keyword">for</span> an executable
0136 work) run the object code and to modify the work, including scripts to
0137 control those activities.  However, it does not include the work's
0138 System Libraries, or general-purpose tools or generally available free
0139 programs which are used unmodified in performing those activities but
0140 which are not part of the work.  For example, Corresponding Source
0141 includes interface definition files associated with source files <span class="keyword">for</span>
0142 the work, and the source code <span class="keyword">for</span> shared libraries and dynamically
0143 linked subprograms that the work is specifically designed to require,
0144 such as by intimate data communication or control flow between those
0145 subprograms and other parts of the work.
0146 
0147   The Corresponding Source need not include anything that users
0148 can regenerate automatically from other parts of the Corresponding
0149 Source.
0150 
0151   The Corresponding Source <span class="keyword">for</span> a work in source code form is that
0152 same work.
0153 
0154   2. Basic Permissions.
0155 
0156   All rights granted under this License are granted <span class="keyword">for</span> the term of
0157 copyright on the Program, and are irrevocable provided the stated
0158 conditions are met.  This License explicitly affirms your unlimited
0159 permission to run the unmodified Program.  The output from running a
0160 covered work is covered by this License only <span class="keyword">if</span> the output, given its
0161 content, constitutes a covered work.  This License acknowledges your
0162 rights of fair use or other equivalent, as provided by copyright law.
0163 
0164   You may make, run and propagate covered works that you do not
0165 convey, without conditions so long as your license <span class="keyword">otherwise</span> remains
0166 in force.  You may convey covered works to others <span class="keyword">for</span> the sole purpose
0167 of having them make modifications exclusively <span class="keyword">for</span> you, or provide you
0168 with facilities <span class="keyword">for</span> running those works, provided that you comply with
0169 the terms of this License in conveying all material <span class="keyword">for</span> which you do
0170 not control copyright.  Those thus making or running the covered works
0171 <span class="keyword">for</span> you must do so exclusively on your behalf, under your direction
0172 and control, on terms that prohibit them from making any copies of
0173 your copyrighted material outside their relationship with you.
0174 
0175   Conveying under any other circumstances is permitted solely under
0176 the conditions stated below.  Sublicensing is not allowed; section 10
0177 makes it unnecessary.
0178 
0179   3. Protecting Users' Legal Rights From Anti-Circumvention Law.
0180 
0181   No covered work shall be deemed part of an effective technological
0182 measure under any applicable law fulfilling obligations under article
0183 11 of the WIPO copyright treaty adopted on 20 December 1996, or
0184 similar laws prohibiting or restricting circumvention of such
0185 measures.
0186 
0187   When you convey a covered work, you waive any legal power to forbid
0188 circumvention of technological measures to the extent such circumvention
0189 is effected by exercising rights under this License with respect to
0190 the covered work, and you disclaim any intention to limit operation or
0191 modification of the work as a means of enforcing, against the work's
0192 users, your or third parties' legal rights to forbid circumvention of
0193 technological measures.
0194 
0195   4. Conveying Verbatim Copies.
0196 
0197   You may convey verbatim copies of the Program's source code as you
0198 receive it, in any medium, provided that you conspicuously and
0199 appropriately publish on each copy an appropriate copyright notice;
0200 keep intact all notices stating that this License and any
0201 non-permissive terms added in accord with section 7 apply to the code;
0202 keep intact all notices of the absence of any warranty; and give all
0203 recipients a copy of this License along with the Program.
0204 
0205   You may charge any price or no price <span class="keyword">for</span> each copy that you convey,
0206 and you may offer support or warranty protection <span class="keyword">for</span> a fee.
0207 
0208   5. Conveying Modified Source Versions.
0209 
0210   You may convey a work based on the Program, or the modifications to
0211 produce it from the Program, in the form of source code under the
0212 terms of section 4, provided that you also meet all of these conditions:
0213 
0214     a) The work must carry prominent notices stating that you modified
0215     it, and giving a relevant date.
0216 
0217     b) The work must carry prominent notices stating that it is
0218     released under this License and any conditions added under section
0219     7.  This requirement modifies the requirement in section 4 to
0220     &quot;keep intact all notices&quot;.
0221 
0222     c) You must license the entire work, as a whole, under this
0223     License to anyone who comes into possession of a copy.  This
0224     License will therefore apply, along with any applicable section 7
0225     additional terms, to the whole of the work, and all its parts,
0226     regardless of how they are packaged.  This License gives no
0227     permission to license the work in any other way, but it does not
0228     invalidate such permission <span class="keyword">if</span> you have separately received it.
0229 
0230     d) If the work has interactive user interfaces, each must display
0231     Appropriate Legal Notices; however, <span class="keyword">if</span> the Program has interactive
0232     interfaces that do not display Appropriate Legal Notices, your
0233     work need not make them do so.
0234 
0235   A compilation of a covered work with other separate and independent
0236 works, which are not by their nature extensions of the covered work,
0237 and which are not combined with it such as to form a larger program,
0238 in or on a volume of a storage or distribution medium, is called an
0239 &quot;aggregate&quot; <span class="keyword">if</span> the compilation and its resulting copyright are not
0240 used to limit the access or legal rights of the compilation's users
0241 beyond what the individual works permit.  Inclusion of a covered work
0242 in an aggregate does not cause this License to apply to the other
0243 parts of the aggregate.
0244 
0245   6. Conveying Non-Source Forms.
0246 
0247   You may convey a covered work in object code form under the terms
0248 of sections 4 and 5, provided that you also convey the
0249 machine-readable Corresponding Source under the terms of this License,
0250 in one of these ways:
0251 
0252     a) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
0253     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by the
0254     Corresponding Source fixed on a durable physical medium
0255     customarily used <span class="keyword">for</span> software interchange.
0256 
0257     b) Convey the object code in, or embodied in, a physical product
0258     (including a physical distribution medium), accompanied by a
0259     written offer, valid <span class="keyword">for</span> at least three years and valid <span class="keyword">for</span> as
0260     long as you offer spare parts or customer support <span class="keyword">for</span> that product
0261     model, to give anyone who possesses the object code either (1) a
0262     copy of the Corresponding Source <span class="keyword">for</span> all the software in the
0263     product that is covered by this License, on a durable physical
0264     medium customarily used <span class="keyword">for</span> software interchange, <span class="keyword">for</span> a price no
0265     more than your reasonable cost of physically performing this
0266     conveying of source, or (2) access to copy the
0267     Corresponding Source from a network server at no charge.
0268 
0269     c) Convey individual copies of the object code with a copy of the
0270     written offer to provide the Corresponding Source.  This
0271     alternative is allowed only occasionally and noncommercially, and
0272     only <span class="keyword">if</span> you received the object code with such an offer, in accord
0273     with subsection 6b.
0274 
0275     d) Convey the object code by offering access from a designated
0276     place (gratis or <span class="keyword">for</span> a charge), and offer equivalent access to the
0277     Corresponding Source in the same way through the same place at no
0278     further charge.  You need not require recipients to copy the
0279     Corresponding Source along with the object code.  If the place to
0280     copy the object code is a network server, the Corresponding Source
0281     may be on a different server (operated by you or a third party)
0282     that supports equivalent copying facilities, provided you maintain
0283     clear directions next to the object code saying where to find the
0284     Corresponding Source.  Regardless of what server hosts the
0285     Corresponding Source, you remain obligated to ensure that it is
0286     available <span class="keyword">for</span> as long as needed to satisfy these requirements.
0287 
0288     e) Convey the object code using peer-to-peer transmission, provided
0289     you inform other peers where the object code and Corresponding
0290     Source of the work are being offered to the general public at no
0291     charge under subsection 6d.
0292 
0293   A separable portion of the object code, whose source code is excluded
0294 from the Corresponding Source as a System Library, need not be
0295 included in conveying the object code work.
0296 
0297   A &quot;User Product&quot; is either (1) a &quot;consumer product&quot;, which means any
0298 tangible personal property which is normally used <span class="keyword">for</span> personal, family,
0299 or household purposes, or (2) anything designed or sold <span class="keyword">for</span> incorporation
0300 into a dwelling.  In determining whether a product is a consumer product,
0301 doubtful cases shall be resolved in favor of coverage.  For a particular
0302 product received by a particular user, &quot;normally used&quot; refers to a
0303 typical or common use of that class of product, regardless of the status
0304 of the particular user or of the way in which the particular user
0305 actually uses, or expects or is expected to use, the product.  A product
0306 is a consumer product regardless of whether the product has substantial
0307 commercial, industrial or non-consumer uses, unless such uses represent
0308 the only significant mode of use of the product.
0309 
0310   &quot;Installation Information&quot; <span class="keyword">for</span> a User Product means any methods,
0311 procedures, authorization keys, or other information required to install
0312 and execute modified versions of a covered work in that User Product from
0313 a modified version of its Corresponding Source.  The information must
0314 suffice to ensure that the continued functioning of the modified object
0315 code is in no <span class="keyword">case</span> prevented or interfered with solely because
0316 modification has been made.
0317 
0318   If you convey an object code work under this section in, or with, or
0319 specifically <span class="keyword">for</span> use in, a User Product, and the conveying occurs as
0320 part of a transaction in which the right of possession and use of the
0321 User Product is transferred to the recipient in perpetuity or <span class="keyword">for</span> a
0322 fixed term (regardless of how the transaction is characterized), the
0323 Corresponding Source conveyed under this section must be accompanied
0324 by the Installation Information.  But this requirement does not apply
0325 <span class="keyword">if</span> neither you nor any third party retains the ability to install
0326 modified object code on the User Product (<span class="keyword">for</span> example, the work has
0327 been installed in ROM).
0328 
0329   The requirement to provide Installation Information does not include a
0330 requirement to <span class="keyword">continue</span> to provide support service, warranty, or updates
0331 <span class="keyword">for</span> a work that has been modified or installed by the recipient, or <span class="keyword">for</span>
0332 the User Product in which it has been modified or installed.  Access to a
0333 network may be denied when the modification itself materially and
0334 adversely affects the operation of the network or violates the rules and
0335 protocols <span class="keyword">for</span> communication across the network.
0336 
0337   Corresponding Source conveyed, and Installation Information provided,
0338 in accord with this section must be in a format that is publicly
0339 documented (and with an implementation available to the public in
0340 source code form), and must require no special password or key <span class="keyword">for</span>
0341 unpacking, reading or copying.
0342 
0343   7. Additional Terms.
0344 
0345   &quot;Additional permissions&quot; are terms that supplement the terms of this
0346 License by making exceptions from one or more of its conditions.
0347 Additional permissions that are applicable to the entire Program shall
0348 be treated as though they were included in this License, to the extent
0349 that they are valid under applicable law.  If additional permissions
0350 apply only to part of the Program, that part may be used separately
0351 under those permissions, but the entire Program remains governed by
0352 this License without regard to the additional permissions.
0353 
0354   When you convey a copy of a covered work, you may at your option
0355 remove any additional permissions from that copy, or from any part of
0356 it.  (Additional permissions may be written to require their own
0357 removal in certain cases when you modify the work.)  You may place
0358 additional permissions on material, added by you to a covered work,
0359 <span class="keyword">for</span> which you have or can give appropriate copyright permission.
0360 
0361   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, <span class="keyword">for</span> material you
0362 add to a covered work, you may (<span class="keyword">if</span> authorized by the copyright holders of
0363 that material) supplement the terms of this License with terms:
0364 
0365     a) Disclaiming warranty or limiting liability differently from the
0366     terms of sections 15 and 16 of this License; or
0367 
0368     b) Requiring preservation of specified reasonable legal notices or
0369     author attributions in that material or in the Appropriate Legal
0370     Notices displayed by works containing it; or
0371 
0372     c) Prohibiting misrepresentation of the origin of that material, or
0373     requiring that modified versions of such material be marked in
0374     reasonable ways as different from the original version; or
0375 
0376     d) Limiting the use <span class="keyword">for</span> publicity purposes of names of licensors or
0377     authors of the material; or
0378 
0379     e) Declining to grant rights under trademark law <span class="keyword">for</span> use of some
0380     trade names, trademarks, or service marks; or
0381 
0382     f) Requiring indemnification of licensors and authors of that
0383     material by anyone who conveys the material (or modified versions of
0384     it) with contractual assumptions of liability to the recipient, <span class="keyword">for</span>
0385     any liability that these contractual assumptions directly impose on
0386     those licensors and authors.
0387 
0388   All other non-permissive additional terms are considered &quot;further
0389 restrictions&quot; within the meaning of section 10.  If the Program as you
0390 received it, or any part of it, contains a notice stating that it is
0391 governed by this License along with a term that is a further
0392 restriction, you may remove that term.  If a license document contains
0393 a further restriction but permits relicensing or conveying under this
0394 License, you may add to a covered work material governed by the terms
0395 of that license document, provided that the further restriction does
0396 not survive such relicensing or conveying.
0397 
0398   If you add terms to a covered work in accord with this section, you
0399 must place, in the relevant source files, a statement of the
0400 additional terms that apply to those files, or a notice indicating
0401 where to find the applicable terms.
0402 
0403   Additional terms, permissive or non-permissive, may be stated in the
0404 form of a separately written license, or stated as exceptions;
0405 the above requirements apply either way.
0406 
0407   8. Termination.
0408 
0409   You may not propagate or modify a covered work except as expressly
0410 provided under this License.  Any attempt <span class="keyword">otherwise</span> to propagate or
0411 modify it is void, and will automatically terminate your rights under
0412 this License (including any patent licenses granted under the third
0413 paragraph of section 11).
0414 
0415   However, <span class="keyword">if</span> you cease all violation of this License, then your
0416 license from a particular copyright holder is reinstated (a)
0417 provisionally, unless and until the copyright holder explicitly and
0418 finally terminates your license, and (b) permanently, <span class="keyword">if</span> the copyright
0419 holder fails to notify you of the violation by some reasonable means
0420 prior to 60 days after the cessation.
0421 
0422   Moreover, your license from a particular copyright holder is
0423 reinstated permanently <span class="keyword">if</span> the copyright holder notifies you of the
0424 violation by some reasonable means, this is the first time you have
0425 received notice of violation of this License (<span class="keyword">for</span> any work) from that
0426 copyright holder, and you cure the violation prior to 30 days after
0427 your receipt of the notice.
0428 
0429   Termination of your rights under this section does not terminate the
0430 licenses of parties who have received copies or rights from you under
0431 this License.  If your rights have been terminated and not permanently
0432 reinstated, you do not qualify to receive new licenses <span class="keyword">for</span> the same
0433 material under section 10.
0434 
0435   9. Acceptance Not Required <span class="keyword">for</span> Having Copies.
0436 
0437   You are not required to accept this License in order to receive or
0438 run a copy of the Program.  Ancillary propagation of a covered work
0439 occurring solely as a consequence of using peer-to-peer transmission
0440 to receive a copy likewise does not require acceptance.  However,
0441 nothing other than this License grants you permission to propagate or
0442 modify any covered work.  These actions infringe copyright <span class="keyword">if</span> you do
0443 not accept this License.  Therefore, by modifying or propagating a
0444 covered work, you indicate your acceptance of this License to do so.
0445 
0446   10. Automatic Licensing of Downstream Recipients.
0447 
0448   Each time you convey a covered work, the recipient automatically
0449 receives a license from the original licensors, to run, modify and
0450 propagate that work, subject to this License.  You are not responsible
0451 <span class="keyword">for</span> enforcing compliance by third parties with this License.
0452 
0453   An &quot;entity transaction&quot; is a transaction transferring control of an
0454 organization, or substantially all assets of one, or subdividing an
0455 organization, or merging organizations.  If propagation of a covered
0456 work results from an entity transaction, each party to that
0457 transaction who receives a copy of the work also receives whatever
0458 licenses to the work the party's predecessor in interest had or could
0459 give under the previous paragraph, plus a right to possession of the
0460 Corresponding Source of the work from the predecessor in interest, <span class="keyword">if</span>
0461 the predecessor has it or can get it with reasonable efforts.
0462 
0463   You may not impose any further restrictions on the exercise of the
0464 rights granted or affirmed under this License.  For example, you may
0465 not impose a license fee, royalty, or other charge <span class="keyword">for</span> exercise of
0466 rights granted under this License, and you may not initiate litigation
0467 (including a cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that
0468 any patent claim is infringed by making, using, selling, offering <span class="keyword">for</span>
0469 sale, or importing the Program or any portion of it.
0470 
0471   11. Patents.
0472 
0473   A &quot;contributor&quot; is a copyright holder who authorizes use under this
0474 License of the Program or a work on which the Program is based.  The
0475 work thus licensed is called the contributor's &quot;contributor version&quot;.
0476 
0477   A contributor's &quot;essential patent claims&quot; are all patent claims
0478 owned or controlled by the contributor, whether already acquired or
0479 hereafter acquired, that would be infringed by some manner, permitted
0480 by this License, of making, using, or selling its contributor version,
0481 but do not include claims that would be infringed only as a
0482 consequence of further modification of the contributor version.  For
0483 purposes of this definition, &quot;control&quot; includes the right to grant
0484 patent sublicenses in a manner consistent with the requirements of
0485 this License.
0486 
0487   Each contributor grants you a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free
0488 patent license under the contributor's essential patent claims, to
0489 make, use, sell, offer <span class="keyword">for</span> sale, import and <span class="keyword">otherwise</span> run, modify and
0490 propagate the <a href="../MultiDOE/src/libs/LHS/contents.html" class="code" title="">contents</a> of its contributor version.
0491 
0492   In the following three paragraphs, a &quot;patent license&quot; is any express
0493 agreement or commitment, however denominated, not to enforce a patent
0494 (such as an express permission to practice a patent or covenant not to
0495 sue <span class="keyword">for</span> patent infringement).  To &quot;grant&quot; such a patent license to a
0496 party means to make such an agreement or commitment not to enforce a
0497 patent against the party.
0498 
0499   If you convey a covered work, knowingly relying on a patent license,
0500 and the Corresponding Source of the work is not available <span class="keyword">for</span> anyone
0501 to copy, free of charge and under the terms of this License, through a
0502 publicly available network server or other readily accessible means,
0503 then you must either (1) cause the Corresponding Source to be so
0504 available, or (2) arrange to deprive yourself of the benefit of the
0505 patent license <span class="keyword">for</span> this particular work, or (3) arrange, in a manner
0506 consistent with the requirements of this License, to extend the patent
0507 license to downstream recipients.  &quot;Knowingly relying&quot; means you have
0508 actual knowledge that, but <span class="keyword">for</span> the patent license, your conveying the
0509 covered work in a country, or your recipient's use of the covered work
0510 in a country, would infringe one or more identifiable patents in that
0511 country that you have reason to believe are valid.
0512 
0513   If, pursuant to or in connection with a single transaction or
0514 arrangement, you convey, or propagate by procuring conveyance of, a
0515 covered work, and grant a patent license to some of the parties
0516 receiving the covered work authorizing them to use, propagate, modify
0517 or convey a specific copy of the covered work, then the patent license
0518 you grant is automatically extended to all recipients of the covered
0519 work and works based on it.
0520 
0521   A patent license is &quot;discriminatory&quot; <span class="keyword">if</span> it does not include within
0522 the scope of its coverage, prohibits the exercise of, or is
0523 conditioned on the non-exercise of one or more of the rights that are
0524 specifically granted under this License.  You may not convey a covered
0525 work <span class="keyword">if</span> you are a party to an arrangement with a third party that is
0526 in the business of distributing software, under which you make payment
0527 to the third party based on the extent of your activity of conveying
0528 the work, and under which the third party grants, to any of the
0529 parties who would receive the covered work from you, a discriminatory
0530 patent license (a) in connection with copies of the covered work
0531 conveyed by you (or copies made from those copies), or (b) primarily
0532 <span class="keyword">for</span> and in connection with specific products or compilations that
0533 contain the covered work, unless you entered into that arrangement,
0534 or that patent license was granted, prior to 28 March 2007.
0535 
0536   Nothing in this License shall be construed as excluding or limiting
0537 any implied license or other defenses to infringement that may
0538 <span class="keyword">otherwise</span> be available to you under applicable patent law.
0539 
0540   12. No Surrender of Others' Freedom.
0541 
0542   If conditions are imposed on you (whether by court order, agreement or
0543 <span class="keyword">otherwise</span>) that contradict the conditions of this License, they do not
0544 excuse you from the conditions of this License.  If you cannot convey a
0545 covered work so as to satisfy simultaneously your obligations under this
0546 License and any other pertinent obligations, then as a consequence you may
0547 not convey it at all.  For example, <span class="keyword">if</span> you agree to terms that obligate you
0548 to collect a royalty <span class="keyword">for</span> further conveying from those to whom you convey
0549 the Program, the only way you could satisfy both those terms and this
0550 License would be to refrain entirely from conveying the Program.
0551 
0552   13. Use with the GNU Affero General Public License.
0553 
0554   Notwithstanding any other provision of this License, you have
0555 permission to link or combine any covered work with a work licensed
0556 under version 3 of the GNU Affero General Public License into a single
0557 combined work, and to convey the resulting work.  The terms of this
0558 License will <span class="keyword">continue</span> to apply to the part which is the covered work,
0559 but the special requirements of the GNU Affero General Public License,
0560 section 13, concerning interaction through a network will apply to the
0561 combination as such.
0562 
0563   14. Revised Versions of this License.
0564 
0565   The Free Software Foundation may publish revised and/or new versions of
0566 the GNU General Public License from time to time.  Such new versions will
0567 be similar in spirit to the present version, but may differ in detail to
0568 address new problems or concerns.
0569 
0570   Each version is given a distinguishing version number.  If the
0571 Program specifies that a certain numbered version of the GNU General
0572 Public License &quot;or any later version&quot; applies to it, you have the
0573 option of following the terms and conditions either of that numbered
0574 version or of any later version published by the Free Software
0575 Foundation.  If the Program does not specify a version number of the
0576 GNU General Public License, you may choose any version ever published
0577 by the Free Software Foundation.
0578 
0579   If the Program specifies that a proxy can decide which future
0580 versions of the GNU General Public License can be used, that proxy's
0581 public statement of acceptance of a version permanently authorizes you
0582 to choose that version <span class="keyword">for</span> the Program.
0583 
0584   Later license versions may give you additional or different
0585 permissions.  However, no additional obligations are imposed on any
0586 author or copyright holder as a result of your choosing to follow a
0587 later version.
0588 
0589   15. Disclaimer of Warranty.
0590 
0591   THERE IS NO WARRANTY FOR THE PROGRAM, TO THE EXTENT PERMITTED BY
0592 APPLICABLE LAW.  EXCEPT WHEN OTHERWISE STATED IN WRITING THE COPYRIGHT
0593 HOLDERS AND/OR OTHER PARTIES PROVIDE THE PROGRAM &quot;AS IS&quot; WITHOUT WARRANTY
0594 OF ANY KIND, EITHER EXPRESSED OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING, BUT NOT LIMITED TO,
0595 THE IMPLIED WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY AND FITNESS FOR A PARTICULAR
0596 PURPOSE.  THE ENTIRE RISK AS TO THE QUALITY AND PERFORMANCE OF THE PROGRAM
0597 IS WITH YOU.  SHOULD THE PROGRAM PROVE DEFECTIVE, YOU ASSUME THE COST OF
0598 ALL NECESSARY SERVICING, REPAIR OR CORRECTION.
0599 
0600   16. Limitation of Liability.
0601 
0602   IN NO EVENT UNLESS REQUIRED BY APPLICABLE LAW OR AGREED TO IN WRITING
0603 WILL ANY COPYRIGHT HOLDER, OR ANY OTHER PARTY WHO MODIFIES AND/OR CONVEYS
0604 THE PROGRAM AS PERMITTED ABOVE, BE LIABLE TO YOU FOR DAMAGES, INCLUDING ANY
0605 GENERAL, SPECIAL, INCIDENTAL OR CONSEQUENTIAL DAMAGES ARISING OUT OF THE
0606 USE OR INABILITY TO USE THE PROGRAM (INCLUDING BUT NOT LIMITED TO LOSS OF
0607 DATA OR DATA BEING RENDERED INACCURATE OR LOSSES SUSTAINED BY YOU OR THIRD
0608 PARTIES OR A FAILURE OF THE PROGRAM TO OPERATE WITH ANY OTHER PROGRAMS),
0609 EVEN IF SUCH HOLDER OR OTHER PARTY HAS BEEN ADVISED OF THE POSSIBILITY OF
0610 SUCH DAMAGES.
0611 
0612   17. Interpretation of Sections 15 and 16.
0613 
0614   If the disclaimer of warranty and limitation of liability provided
0615 above cannot be given local legal effect according to their terms,
0616 reviewing courts shall apply local law that most closely approximates
0617 an absolute waiver of all civil liability in connection with the
0618 Program, unless a warranty or assumption of liability accompanies a
0619 copy of the Program in <span class="keyword">return</span> <span class="keyword">for</span> a fee.
0620 
0621                      END OF TERMS AND CONDITIONS</pre></div>
